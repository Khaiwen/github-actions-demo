# Getting started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for your project.
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

2. Maintain a requirements.txt to track and install specific dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To list all the Python dependencies installed in your environment, you can use the `pip list` command.
